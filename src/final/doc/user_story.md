# User Story

## Sign Up

As a new user, I want to sign up for an account using my email, eliminating the need for an additional username. This process will also ensure I can receive important emails from the app.

## Sign In

As a user, I want to securely sign in to the system to track my income and expenses. Additionally, I value account safety and would like to receive email notifications in case of sign-ins from new or different devices for added security.

## Sign Out

As a user, I want to be able to sign out of the system from the device, so that I can prevent my account from potential account theft. All my information should be removed from the device, so that even an experienced hacker cannot get the private information from it.

## Close Account

As a user, I want the ability to cancel my account, ensuring that all my personal and financial data are securely removed from the system, and any associated account data, including personal information, transactions, budgets, and history are permanently deleted.

## Create Category

As a user, I want to be able to create a new expense category, allowing me to customize and organize my expenses according to my specific needs. Besides, I want the App to ensure that the category name is unique, and give me a warning if the category I am about to create has existed. 

## Create Subcategory

As a user, I want the capability to create a subcategory within an existing category, allowing me to manage and track my expenses in a more granular and organized manner. Additionally, I want the App to ensure that the subcategory name is unique within its parent category, and give me a warning if the subcategory I am about to create has existed.

## Create Record

As a user, I want the ability to create a financial record, inputting details such as income or expense amount, associated category, subcategory (if applicable), and transaction date. I also expect the app to automatically populate the date field with today's date as the default when I create a new record.

## Edit or Delete Record

As a user, I want the capability to edit or delete financial records, ensuring accuracy and currency. This will enable me to promptly rectify erroneous entries and remove records when receiving refunds for specific expenses.

## Budget

As a user, I want the ability to establish budget limits for both expense categories and subcategories. I aim to receive timely notifications or emails as I approach or surpass these budget limits. This feature will enable me to proactively manage my spending, aligning with my budget and making necessary adjustments to stay within financial constraints.

## View Data

As a user, I want the ability to view my financial data presented in a balance sheet or table format, comprehensively displaying my income, expenses, and the resulting balance. Furthermore, I would like the numerical amounts to be visually distinguishable: displaying in red font if the amount is negative, indicating losses or expenses, and in green font if the amount is positive, denoting gains or income. This color-based representation will enhance clarity and enable quick identification of financial trends and status.

## View Data for a Certain Category

As a user, I want the capability to access and view my financial data for a specific category in a clear balance sheet or table format. This display should include details such as the transaction date, associated subcategory, and corresponding amounts. This functionality will allow me to swiftly obtain an insightful overview of the income or expense associated with a particular category, helping me better manage my finances.

## Visualize Expenses for a Subcategory

As a user, I want the ability to visualize my expenses of a certain subcategory over time using graphs, allowing me to analyze spending patterns and trends. Additionally, I want to be able to view my data on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and phones, and I also want the charts to be responsive on all devices. 

## Visualize Expenses for a Category

As a user, I want the functionality to visualize my expenses within a specific category over time using graphical representations, such as line graphs or bar charts. Furthermore, I also desire the capability to view the expenses of different subcategories within the selected category through intuitive pie charts. This can help me identify and understand the proportions of expenses attributed to each subcategory.

## Export Data

As a user, I want to export my financial data into downloadable formats like Excel, CSV, or PDF. This data can serve as personal reports or for reporting purposes. Additionally, I desire the option to specify the date range and select specific subcategories for the data I intend to export, enhancing customization and relevance.
