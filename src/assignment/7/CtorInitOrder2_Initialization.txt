Steps of initializations:
1. MyClass constructor.
2. Bar constructor. During the instantiation of MyClass, and before the MyClass constructor code block is executed, a Bar instance, which is in the initializer list, is to be created.
3. Foo constructor. Bar extends Foo, and thus before the Bar constructor code block is executed, a Foo instance is to be created.
4. Upon the Foo constructor code block is being executed, the Bar constructor code block is being executed. Subsequently, the MyClass constructor code block will be executed.

With analysis above, we can conclude that the output strings are in the following order:

Foo::mValue = 1.2
Bar value = 1.2
MyClass::mValue = 1.2
